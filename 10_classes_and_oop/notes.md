 # javascript and classes
 Q: Do JS really have classes?
 Yes, js does have classes. This feature was introduced with ECMAScript2015 specification(ES6). However its oimportant to note that js is primarily a prototyoe based language and its classes are primarily syntactic sugarover existing prototype-based inheritance mehanisms. In other words, it provides a more familiar syntax for developers coming from class absed languages such as c++, java, but under the hood , it works somewhat differently.
 * sirf syntax de dia gaya hai tak developers miss out na feel kryn k js mai classes object s nhi hei,,, behind the scenes abbhi bhi prototype based inheritance mechanism hai
