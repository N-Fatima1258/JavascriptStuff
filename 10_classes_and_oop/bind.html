<!--  
The bind keyword in JavaScript is used to create a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to a specified value. This is particularly useful when working with event handlers in classes, as it ensures that the correct context (this) is maintained. -->

<!-- Without bind
If you didn't use bind, this inside handleClick would refer to the element that triggered the event (the button), leading to undefined or incorrect behavior.
            console.log(this.server); => undefined
-->

<!-- Using bind:
this.handleClick.bind(this) creates a new function with this bound to the current instance of the React class. 
This ensures that inside handleClick, this refers to the instance of the React class, not to the button element or the global object.-->
